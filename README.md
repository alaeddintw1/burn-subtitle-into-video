# burn-subtitle-into-video
Python3 script tool for burning .srt subtitle file to a video.

you only need to place the sahel.ttf (true type font) inside 
same folder + video file + .srt (subtitle file).

Output will be 3 files:
1>hardcoded subtitle to mp4 file.
2>silent video file without subtitles.
3>Text file contains only subtitle texts without srt formatting.

just run as following:
>python3 HardCodeSrt_v1.py

it will ask for video file name + srt file name (must be inside same running this script folder).

Hope it help someone....as i was in a need for such a tool and didnt found free and working tool.

Plz execuse my programming coding mess as i was in a hurry and its not commercial ;).

Sincere Rgds.
